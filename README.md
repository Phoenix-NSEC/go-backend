# go-backend
awesome Go Backend for our state of the art react app , and maybe an upcoming flutter app (just maybe).

## Development Rules
- Don't push directly to main (ever)
- Don't push to dev directly either.
- Try creating PR's and tag @shreyamMaity or @unownone for codereviews.
- Create individual branches pulling from `dev` branch whenever implementing a bugfix or a new feature.
- Add test cases everytime you add something new.
- Make sure you don't merge without a PR.
- Code safe and stock up on Coffee.
- We accept outside PR's given all test cases are passed and nothing malicious is found.
